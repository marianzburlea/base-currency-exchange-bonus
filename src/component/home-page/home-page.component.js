      <h1>Welcome to the awesome EchangeRator</h1>
      <p>We are using lots and lots of cutting edge alien technology, like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fashion Styled Components</li>
        <li>Super React Hooks</li>
        <li>Ultra CSS Variables</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We are also using the <strong>index.js</strong> trick for cleaner and
        nicer imports as well as easier jumps when developing when making use of{" "}
        <code>CTRL + P</code> and file name to be searched.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course we could not miss the featured based structure where we can
        easily find all files responsible for a certain feature in the same
        place. This benefits by reducing the develpment time which can be used
        to develop other features or update the knowledge base through research.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's not forget that we can always split files into smaller ones aiming
        to increase responsability while decreasing time to search through a
        file and understand it. There is so much you can keep in your head at
        one time before stress settles in and you become less productive.

      <h2>Use Reach Router</h2>
      <p>A few reasons to use this library are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Easy to use and understand</li>
        <li>
          Router manages the focus of your app on route transitions. Thereâ€™s
          nothing you have to do about it, it just happens.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
